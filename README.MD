## Introduction

The E-Commerce API is a feature-rich backend application that provides a comprehensive set of APIs for managing an e-commerce platform. It enables you to handle product management, user authentication, order processing, reviews, payments, and more.

## Features

- User authentication and authorization
- Product management (creation, retrieval, update, deletion)
- Order processing (creation, retrieval, update, deletion)
- Review management (creation, retrieval)
- Payment processing integration
- Error handling middleware
- Logging middleware

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the E-Commerce API locally.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- MongoDB database

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/e-commerce-api.git
```


2. Navigate to the project directory:
```
cd e-commerce-api
```


3. Install dependencies:
```
npm install
```


### Configuration
1. Create a `.env` file in the project root directory.
2. Add the following environment variables to the `.env` file and set their respective values:
```
PORT=5000
MONGODB_URI=your-mongodb-uri
API_KEY=your-api-key
```

Replace `your-mongodb-uri` with the MongoDB connection URI and `your-api-key` with a secret key for API authentication.

## Usage

To start the API server, run the following command:
```
npm start
``` 


The API will be accessible at `http://localhost:5000`.

## API Documentation

The API documentation is available at [API Documentation](https://your-api-documentation-url.com). It provides detailed information on available endpoints, request/response formats, and authentication requirements.

## Deployment

To deploy the E-Commerce API to a production environment, follow these steps:

1. Set up a production-ready MongoDB database.
2. Configure the environment variables for the production environment.
3. Use a process manager like PM2 or systemd to manage the Node.js process and ensure high availability.

## Monitoring and Management

For process monitoring and management, we recommend using PM2. Follow these steps to set up PM2:

1. Install PM2 globally:
```
npm install pm2 -g
```

2. Start the API server using PM2:
```
pm2 start npm -- start
```
PM2 will automatically handle process monitoring, automatic restarts, and log management.
